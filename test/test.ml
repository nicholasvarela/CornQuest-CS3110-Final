(*Testing Plan: Our plan for testing is to test as many parts of the codebase
  using automated OUnit testing. We tested components as they were built. For
  example, one of our first sprints included the creation of the
  chraracter.ml/character.mli files to represent a sprite in our RPG. We tested
  that subsection before using the character.ml representation, in our battle
  simulation, whose functionality is mostly under battle.ml/battle.mli*)

(*Manually Tested Componenets battle.ml functions attack had a random call, so
  they could not be tested with OUnit battle.ml functions. We focused on testing
  functions that were exposed in the respective .mli file, internal functions
  were solved indirectly. GUI Components like gameobj.ml, tilemap.ml and
  tileset.ml textman.mli*)

(*OUnit Tested Componenets : character.ml/character.mi -We utilized OUnit and
  glass box testing in order to throughly test that our implementation of
  character worked as expected. Since, we predicted that sprites would be used
  throughout our game, we made sure to be especially careful in testing the
  getters/setter of the character's attributes *)

(*Arugment for correctness of program given testing strategy: *)
