(** Representation of tileset data.

    This module represents the data stored in tileset files. It handles loading
    of that data from the JSON as well as querying of the data, and includes
    useful functions for tilemaps to extract data from tilesets.*)

type t
(**The abstract type representing tileset data.*)

val load_tileset : string -> Tsdl.Sdl.renderer -> t
(**[load_tileset fl ren] is the tileset contained in the JSON file [fl].
   Renderer [ren] is used to generate the associated texture. Requires: [fl] is
   a well-formed JSON tileset file generated by Tiled.*)

val get_tile : t -> int -> Tsdl.Sdl.rect
(**[get_tile tset id] is the [Tsdl.Sdl.rect] containing the tile specified by
   [gid] in the tileset [tset].*)

val get_tex : t -> Tsdl.Sdl.texture
(**[get_tex tset] is the [Tsdl.Sdl.texture] associated with [tset].*)
