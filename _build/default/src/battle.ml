(** The type [action] represents the action that can be part of a player's fight
    command. The player can choose to physically attack, guard, cast a spell, or
    attempt to flee. The [Attack] action carries a [string] that represents the
    target's name; the [Cast] action carries a [string] tuple that represents
    the target's name and the spell's name, respectively.*)
