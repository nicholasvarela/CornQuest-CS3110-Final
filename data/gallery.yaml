  Our project is a classic Role-Playing Game similar to Final Fantasy games 
  with a Cornell Theme. Players will traverse maps to explore different Cornell
  locales. There is a flat world map interface where a player's party can travel
  in. The game with include random enemy encounters which result in battles. 

  Players will also have an inventory and character leveling system. NPCs will 
  interact with the players along the way to exapnd the storyline. 
  Estimated playtime will be around 2 hours.
